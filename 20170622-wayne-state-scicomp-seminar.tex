% Title:
% Building the Research Software Cyberinfrastructure for Particle Physics
%
% Abstract:
% If you visit a laboratory hosting particle physics experiments,
% such as Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory or the European Laboratory for
% Particle Physics (CERN), you will likely be introduced to the
% basic infrastructure of these labs: large particle detectors, even larger
% particle accelerators and perhaps racks of computers in the computer
% center. In practice, another invisible part of the infrastructure ties
% together many of these labs and often outlasts the physically visible
% infrastructure: the software used to manage, process and analyze the
% data produced by the experiments. In this talk I will give an overview
% of the nature and evolution of this research software infrastructure.
% I will also discuss current efforts to build national and international
% collaborations between physicists, computer scientists and industry
% to do the R&D needed for the software for the next generation of particle
% physics experiments.

% Bio:
% Peter Elmer is an experimental particle physicist whose area of
% expertise is developing the software and computing systems needed
% to operate and produce scientific results from high energy physics
% experiments. His current research focuses on the Compact Muon
% Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the
% European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). In the past he has
% worked on the ALEPH experiment at CERN and the BaBar experiment at
% the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). He received a Ph.D.
% in Experimental High Energy Physics from the University of
% Wisconsin - Madison and is a staff researcher at Princeton University
% since 2001.
