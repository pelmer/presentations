\begin{itemize}
\item We have a good draft. We need to agree on and finalize the content.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.15in

We need to make concrete plans for how we intend to work and how we start our activities this
year
\begin{itemize}
\item This is more detailed than the PEP
\item We need to build the concrete internal collaborations 
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.15in

We need to make concrete plans for how we will build external collaborations

\begin{itemize}
\item With the LHC Ops programs, with the experiments, with other HL-LHC focused R\&D projects (DOE, NSF, international)

%In this meeting we need to evaluate our activities over the past year, and planned in the next months, relative to the overall project goals. 
%\vskip 0.15in
%Now that the project is fully staffed and past the ``bootstrap'' phase, we should also put in place a public ``project plan'' to communicate to others.
%\vskip 0.15in
%We are not aiming to hash out specific technical details of projects in this meeting. Detailed technical discussions should be deferred to dedicated discussions or a DIANA topical meeting, as appropriate.
%\vskip 0.15in
%Going forward, we will have these project meetings more frequently. Today I am only outlining the most general goals and we can discuss at the end. We will
%probably need another in mid-January to go through things in greater detail.
