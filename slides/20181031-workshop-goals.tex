\frametitle{Goals of this meeting}

We need to finish the PEP \\
\begin{itemize}
\item We have a good draft. We need to agree on and finalize the content.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.15in
We need to make concrete plans for how we intend to work and how we start this
year
\begin{itemize}
\item This is more detailed than the PEP
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.15in

In this meeting we need to evaluate our activities over the past year, and planned in the next months, relative to the overall project goals. 
\vskip 0.15in
Now that the project is fully staffed and past the ``bootstrap'' phase, we should also put in place a public ``project plan'' to communicate to others.
\vskip 0.15in
We are not aiming to hash out specific technical details of projects in this meeting. Detailed technical discussions should be deferred to dedicated discussions or a DIANA topical meeting, as appropriate.
\vskip 0.15in
Going forward, we will have these project meetings more frequently. Today I am only outlining the most general goals and we can discuss at the end. We will
probably need another in mid-January to go through things in greater detail.
