\frametitle{Community White Paper (CWP) Goals}

To prepare for the challenges of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the CWP should identify and prioritize the software research and development investments required:

\begin{enumerate}
\item to achieve improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance and to make use of the advances in CPU, storage and network technologies
\item to enable new approaches to computing and software that could radically extend the physics reach of the detectors
\item to ensure the long term sustainability of the software through the lifetime of the HL-LHC
\end{enumerate}
