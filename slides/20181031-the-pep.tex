\begin{itemize}
\item This is due 90 days after the award date (of 1 Sept.)
\item We have a good draft, which NSF has seen. 
\item We should come out of this workshop with the main {\em content} done, and needing at most some simple polish/edit passes before submission.
\item Key items: deliverables/milestones, metrics, risks and the ``Software and Data'' section
\item The contents will be used as part of the 18 months review!
\end{itemize}
