\frametitle{Goals of this meeting}

In this meeting we need to evaluate our activities over the past year, and planned in the next months, relative to the overall project goals. 
\vskip 0.15in
Now that the project is fully staffed and past the ``bootstrap'' phase, we should also put in place a public ``project plan'' to communicate to others.
\vskip 0.15in
We are not aiming to hash out specific technical details of projects in this meeting. Detailed technical discussions should be deferred to dedicated discussions or a DIANA topical meeting, as appropriate.
\vskip 0.15in
Going forward, we will have these project meetings more frequently. Today I am only outlining the most general goals and we can discuss at the end. We will
probably need another in mid-January to go through things in greater detail.
