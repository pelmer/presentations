\begin{itemize}
\item (See previous slide about ROOT file format)
\item Distributed computing centers requires distributed data management
\item More than just file transfers: manage retries, global placement, cleanup, archival to tape, etc.
\item Initial computing model involved static data placement in sites for access by jobs running on local compute notes
\item In recent years, we have evolved to use technologies (xrootd) allowing efficient remote (WAN) access to data: evolving global ``data federations''
\end{itemize}
