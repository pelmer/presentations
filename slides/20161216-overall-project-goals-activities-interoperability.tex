\frametitle{Interoperability}

\textbf{Interoperability:}
we will reposition these key libraries to better interoperate with
the larger scientific software ecosystem, transitioning the field
to a more sustainable path where {\em new ideas
and software developed elsewhere can be more easily used in particle physics}
and our best products can be evaluated by other fields.
We will create modular versions of the libraries that work
both within the traditional ROOT framework as well as
within other frameworks such as Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark,
Mathematica, Python and R.
