\begin{itemize}
\item Guidelines: http://codas-hep.org/pages/reimbursement.html
\item Don't worry about it now, unless something special has come up. We can come back to it on Thursday at the end of the school.
\item We should have a form available in the next couple of days
\item We would like to receive reimbursement requests by 1 week after the school (Friday, 21 July, 2017).
\end{itemize}
