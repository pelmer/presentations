\frametitle{Performance}

\textbf{Performance:} we will greatly increase parallelism and eliminate CPU- and IO-bottlenecks to achieve higher processing rates necessary to efficiently
and expeditiously analyze large volumes of data.
We will address some key design and implementation
issues from the early days of ROOT which impact
not only performance, but also the manageability of the software.
