\begin{itemize}
\item HEP offers at-scale production-capable systems for a variety of CS research topics: scalable systems, data management, paralel
\item ``industry scale, academic openness''
\item Developing collaborations requires HEP to recognize that CS research interests differ from HEP research interests.
\item Communication gaps exist: not only jargon, but also in simply formulating the problem to solve. Significant assumptions and/or incomplete problem descriptions. HEP people often describe the problem in terms of the solution we have at the moment.
\item Recognition that building common terminology and involving CS researchers earlier in the process will be beneficial.
