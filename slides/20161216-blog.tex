\frametitle{Blog and Website}

We have had the idea of a DIANA blog since some time. The original idea
was that we could have some content generated by DIANA team members and 
some ``invited'' content.

The current website has a placeholder for this, although it has only really
been used for a few ``news'' items. 
\vskip 0.15in
Should we pursue this? More generally should we aim for changes to the website?
