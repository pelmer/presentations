\begin{itemize}
\item IRIS-HEP Grad or Undergrad Fellows will spend 3 months intensively developing software tools in conjunction with either IRIS-HEP personnel or with collaborating institutions.
\item Fellows can work on software relevant for any area of the Institute (IA, AS, DOMA, SSL, OSG-LHC)
\item Fellows are a key ingredient to building an ever larger community around the Institute as an intellectual hub.
\item We also have funds for some number of DIANA/HEP fellows, to work on analysis tools
