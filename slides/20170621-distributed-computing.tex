\frametitle{Distributed Computing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing resources are made available to the LHC experiments in a distributed fashion
\item Significant collaboration with computer science on distributed high throughput computing via the Open Science Grid (OSG)
\item \url{https://www.opensciencegrid.org/}
\item Expected evolution in the coming years: a mix of ``owned'' resources, commercial cloud resources and use of (in particular DOE) HPC resources
\item Likely this will be more ``dynamic'' than the use of only ``owned'' (dedicated) resources as in the Grid
\end{itemize}
