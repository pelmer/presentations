\frametitle{Collaborative Analysis}

\textbf{Collaborative Analysis:}
we will provide new tools that build on the concept and emerging practices
in particle physics that data analysis is a collaborative activity, involving
many individuals working within a given experiment, working in different
experiments and even between the experimental and theory communities.
This will involve directly integrating into the analysis tool suite the
ability to capture elements of analysis workflows needed to satisfy
best practices in data preservation, analysis archival, reproducibility,
and open access.
