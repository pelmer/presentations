\begin{itemize}
\item Widely used software framework for data analysis in high energy and nuclear physics
\item Builds on concepts from an earlier generation of Fortran-tools (PAW, HBOOK, etc.) developed at CERN
\item \url{https://root.cern.ch/}
\item I/O system - stores streamed objects in compressed, column-wise organized files with ``out of memory'' data access. It is the common I/O file format in HEP.
\item Plus statistical, data modeling and mathematical tools, visualization toolkits, tools for optimized remote data access and  also historical HEP tools for machine learning.
