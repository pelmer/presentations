\begin{itemize}
\item Thank you all for your patience in putting together the ``Year 1'' budgets, justifications and draft SOWs. Iterating next year will be more straightforward.
\item Those draft Year 1 budgets, SOWs, etc. were all sent 10 days ago to the responsible in the Princeton SRO who handles subwards
\item She is working with Floe towards the actual initiation of the subawards
\item We can discuss this and other things in the dedicated management breakout session tomorrow
