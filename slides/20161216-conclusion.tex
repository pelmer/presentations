\frametitle{Summary}

In this presentation I've shown the ``big picture'' goals we have for the DIANA project, as well as the NSF SI2 program context.
\vskip 0.15in
After the presentations we should ask ourselves specifics about how our activities and plans are fully aligned with those goals, whether there are missing elements and discuss a common DIANA project plan for 2017.
\vskip 0.15in
We should probably meet again in mid-January to iterate on the full project plan for 2017 and prepare for the DIANA AB meeting in San Diego.
