\begin{itemize}
\item (Geographically) Distributed High Throughput Computing
\item Currently aggregating resources from US Universities (NSF and local
compute), DOE labs (FNAL, BNL, SLAC), and international 
\item Going forward we expect we will need to aggregate over ``owned'' resources, DOE HPC resources (e.g. NERSC, ANL, ORNL) {\it and} commercial clouds
\item FNAL HEPCloud: demonstrated at-scale use with AWS and Google Cloud 
\item TIFR Mumbai currently testing with Microsoft Azure
\item DOE (HTC on) HPC: Ongoing work to use Mira (ANL) and Edison/Cori (NERSC)
\end{itemize}
