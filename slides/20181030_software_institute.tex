\frametitle{IRIS-HEP - A Software Institute}

\begin{itemize}
\item Technically IRIS-HEP is funded by NSF as a 5 year project, and we need clear deliverables on different time scales
\item We are however building more than that, something more than the sum of the pieces (deliverables, etc.)
\item We are building a ``Software Institute'', which means: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item activities serving a larger, common purpose 
  \item interconnected R\&D activites
  \item intellectual hub for the community
  \end{itemize}
\item We need to aim at clear deliverables, but we shouldn't completely lose the forest for the trees at this workshop.
\end{itemize}
