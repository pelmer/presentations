\frametitle{Collaborations and Community Building}

Building new collaborations is an additional objective of the DIANA/HEP 
project. The ``vision for DIANA extends beyond the work the project team will

from universities, national, and international labs as well as the private 
sector to catalyze a broad effort.''

Similarly ``building community'' around the software is critical and a primary metric for success.

We have in fact been doing both this year. We should continue to build both collaborations and communities. This should not be incidental or ``passive'': activities in this direction (not just an occasional talk!) should be an integral part of the plan.
