\frametitle{Collaboration with DOE projects}

\begin{itemize}
\item An important element of our external collaborations will be with DOE efforts towards HL-LHC
\item This workshop is {\bf not} intended to fully understand IRIS-HEP/DOE project relationships, and we did not invite systematically the relevant people on the DOE side
\item We first need to get our basic plans in order (in this workshop)
\item We then hope to work with our DOE colleagues to organize a follow-up IRIS-HEP/NSF/DOE strategic planning workshop (using remaining S2I2-HEP funds), in the vein of the S2I2-HEP CUA workshop
\item Relevant DOE individuals, among others, should also be involved in some targeted workshops
\end{itemize}
