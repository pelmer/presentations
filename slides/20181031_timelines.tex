Institute Design Phase (First 2 Years)
\begin{itemize}
\item First deliverables
\item Major review at 18 months
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.15in

Institute Execution Phase (Years 3-5)
\begin{itemize}
\item Deployment of major systems during Run 3 that will be needed for HL-LHC challenges
\item Reviews at 30 months and 42 months
\end{itemize}

The timescale of HL-HLC
\begin{itemize}
\item IRIS-HEP has been funded for 5 years, but HL-LHC will only start in 2026
\item NSF has left open the possibility of a renewal for an additional 5 years
\item Regardless of the specifics of funding, we should be building an organization that can last and be impactful through the HL-LHC era
\end{itemize}
